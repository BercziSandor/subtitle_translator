1
00:00:04,112 --> 00:00:05,884
Previously on Billions.

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:07,209
I want to introduce the chairman of

3
00:00:07,242 --> 00:00:09,845
the NYC 2028 Olympic Commission,

4
00:00:09,878 --> 00:00:10,946
Michael Prince.

5
00:00:11,588 --> 00:00:12,911
Thank you, Mayor Johnson.

6
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,282
You promised me a winning season, Chuck.

7
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:15,784
Running out of time
before I'll have to quit,

8
00:00:15,817 --> 00:00:17,352
campaign 25/8.

9
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:19,988
I can't lose my MVP yet.
I need you, Kate.

10
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:21,590
Chuck Rhoades is fucking
with our Wi-Fi play.

11
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:24,591
The only winner in this
hopeless fucking outing

12
00:00:24,626 --> 00:00:26,109
is gonna be your chief legal counsel.

13
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:27,229
You think I'm concerned because you

14
00:00:27,262 --> 00:00:29,197
brought my Wi-Fi play back to Chuck?

15
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,366
It's how I know that you'll
serve me loyally as well,

16
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,368
until I help get you
elected to Congress.

17
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:35,256
You made a deal that you
knew would displease me.

18
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,339
I thought we could
actually change the world.

19
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:39,941
If you want to change the world,
nine digits ain't gonna do it.

20
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:41,076
How could you, Kate?

21
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:42,742
After all I taught you.

22
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:44,346
You made me wait.

23
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:45,680
What if the professor
isn't done teaching?

24
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,282
This is business.

25
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:48,950
This is what not having
a soft landing feels like.

26
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:50,805
You tear your butt when
you hit the ground.

27
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,287
Mike Prince and his daughters

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,031
made the world a better place today.

29
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:55,991
I lost my advantage.

30
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:58,990
I failed to protect my goddamn queen.

31
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,295
Welcome to Michael Prince Capital, Kate.

32
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:23,385
My God, let me finish!

33
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:26,235
When was I not letting you finish?

34
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:43,605
Worked pretty well in
Stand and Deliver too.

35
00:01:43,638 --> 00:01:44,973
Life lesson,

36
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:47,575
always carry a cleaver.

37
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,244
Oh, wait. No.

38
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:50,812
That's not really the lesson.

39
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:52,447
The lesson is,

40
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,684
know how to change the
mood in a room quickly

41
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:57,352
and with authority.

42
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:59,220
Now, look,
I get what you're fighting over.

43
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:00,388
I do.

44
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,290
Coding team wants more of the budget

45
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:04,426
because you can't make a
great app without great code.

46
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,424
Sales team wants more because
who cares about the damn code...

47
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:08,763
You want to start moving
product out the door.

48
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,665
Same with the marketing group.

49
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:12,266
But here's the deal.

50
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:15,770
Your customer can have two of these,

51
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,272
not three.

52
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:19,274
Cheap and fast can't also be good.

53
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:21,242
Good and fast can't also be cheap.

54
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:24,179
So you can fight over turf,

55
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:25,513
or...

56
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,050
you can figure out a vision.

57
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:31,987
Let the budget sort itself out.

58
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,021
Or I can double it.

59
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:36,491
Everybody gets what they want,

60
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,460
and I get a word with
the teacher outside.

61
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,628
Not sure that's the right lesson.

62
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,570
Most important one:
"Money makes the rules."

63
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:45,633
I'm surprised an esteemed
charter school like this

64
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,169
hasn't hammered it into their heads.

65
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,839
Why scrap over capital
when you can raise it?

66
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:52,974
Group, we're gonna take five

67
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,076
while Mr. Prince makes out his check.

68
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:59,114
If you came here to impress a bunch of

69
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:00,582
teenage entrepreneurs...

70
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:01,683
Trying to impress you.

71
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:03,818
Hire you. How am I doing?

72
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,153
You opening a charter school?

73
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:06,988
Not for your side gig. Your main gig.

74
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,890
They take care of me at the fund I'm at.

75
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:12,160
Hmm-hmm. That's why
your resume's floating around.

76
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:14,362
In my weaker moments,
I sometimes think about

77
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:16,564
what I could do in a place
built for speed and power.

78
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,432
Then you're talking to the right guy.

79
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,909
Um,

80
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:29,076
what'd you do?

81
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,379
Nothing.

82
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:33,248
Women can be irrational, we know this.

83
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,816
"We" do not. What'd you do?

84
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,084
Not a thing.

85
00:03:36,117 --> 00:03:38,253
I went unattended to a couples dinner.

86
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:40,688
Willow had a cold,
so Roxanne couldn't go.

87
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,924
And the distaff side of the other couple

88
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:44,626
was a fetching brunette...

89
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:47,262
Yeah, you had an affair.
Spare me the Penthouse Forum.

90
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,764
No-siree-Bob. Nothing physical.

91
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:51,533
Developed a kinship

92
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:54,903
with Judith Felker, Ron's wife,

93
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:57,639
over how thin the consommé was.

94
00:03:57,672 --> 00:04:01,470
So uh, Roxanne kicked you out
over dinner table chatter?

95
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:04,282
Well, the next six days of
text chatter didn't help.

96
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:07,582
Did you know that Face ID
works when you're asleep?

97
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:08,883
Why wouldn't it?

98
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,185
You oughta go after Big Tech.

99
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:12,287
I dozed off mid-emoji,

100
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,264
Roxanne grabbed the damn
phone and saw it all.

101
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,626
I'll just drop this here
while I test the beds,

102
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,628
pick out a room.

103
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,442
_

104
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,780
The thing about self-help is,

105
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,715
if you're getting it from
someone else it's not self,

106
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:43,084
and if you're doing it yourself,
you didn't really get help.

107
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:49,691
Carlin.

108
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:51,926
George Carlin. No?

109
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,461
Yeah. All-time great.

110
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,530
But not quite like Coach Wooden.

111
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:58,833
See, he wasn't an entertainer.

112
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,135
He understood life.

113
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:01,603
Codified what he learned,

114
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:03,371
taught it to his basketball players,

115
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:05,223
made it available to the rest of us.

116
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:08,076
As I am now making it available to you.

117
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:10,778
"Initiative," "skill,"

118
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,249
it all seems kinda... basic.

119
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:16,484
Not ItsMeTinx basic.
Like what it used to mean.

120
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,957
I met him once, when we won State's.

121
00:05:18,992 --> 00:05:21,049
Fundamental, not basic. It's different.

122
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:22,590
What'd he teach ya?

123
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,459
How to put on my socks and shoes.

124
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:26,427
How to lace 'em up and tie 'em right.

125
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,862
Know why?

126
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,097
Blisters?

127
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,431
To remember that every season,

128
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,933
we start again from the beginning.

129
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:35,537
We were champions of this season.
Not the next.

130
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,538
So we'd better do everything right.

131
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:40,708
Plus, yeah, blisters.

132
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,454
Not self-help.

133
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:44,678
Help.

134
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,824
- Who's that?
- Beats me.

135
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,160
Ten bucks says he doesn't
have any blisters.

136
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,865
Remember,
you're bowing to the Buddha, not me.

137
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,633
Yes.

138
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:44,038
Daniel.

139
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,606
I'm ready.

140
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,912
Is that the first sign of readiness,
do we think?

141
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:53,514
Stating it.

142
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:56,417
Are you suggesting I'm
not ready to take refuge?

143
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:58,819
Because I have to.

144
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,256
I need to.

145
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,660
What's that?

146
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:06,694
Vegan ice cream.

147
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,830
A gift for you. It's the best...

148
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:10,064
No.

149
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,599
What's that?

150
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:15,236
A gift for you, as I said.

151
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,738
I made it myself.

152
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:18,172
For what purpose?

153
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:22,076
For... to, uh...

154
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,644
To curry favor.

155
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:27,115
The very sweetness of the cream

156
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:28,783
is bitter in this way.

157
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,618
Do not buy friendship

158
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:31,819
or comfort.

159
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,459
Where I come from,

160
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,995
everything's a transaction.

161
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,997
Where you're going...

162
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,465
a commitment to the Buddha,

163
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:47,568
the Dharma, the Sangha,

164
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:51,605
the goal is to avoid being
transactional at all.

165
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,776
Can you do this?

166
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,477
Will you try?

167
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:00,048
I'll start with a month. Go from there.

168
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,249
Start with a day.

169
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:03,351
When I decide something...

170
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:06,253
Start with an hour, even a minute.

171
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:08,822
Then add a minute on to that one.

172
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:12,560
That's the work.

173
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:16,631
We'll meet again in four days,
see how it's going.

174
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:19,067
You're not sure I can
refrain from transacting

175
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,468
for four days?

176
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,604
Whether I'm sure matters not at all.

177
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:26,307
Well, I am.

178
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,443
I'm sure.

179
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:34,381
All right, rack the bid, get it done.

180
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,052
What's he, the new golden boy?

181
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,188
Took Dollar Bill's slot.

182
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:42,724
Probably looking for the
actual dollar to steal too.

183
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:45,473
Coach Wooden always said,

184
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:47,995
"I treat my players fairly,
but not equally.

185
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,664
Depends on performance."

186
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:51,666
And that's what we are evaluating now.
Performance.

187
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,897
Evaluate and decide who starts,
who rides the pine...

188
00:08:54,932 --> 00:08:56,137
And who gets their scholarship pulled.

189
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,905
Now, I've always believed
you live in a house

190
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,407
before renovating,

191
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,743
so you don't sledgehammer
a support beam,

192
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:04,612
put a Barcalounger
where the bar should be.

193
00:09:04,647 --> 00:09:07,840
Well, our grace period
here is coming to an end.

194
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:11,018
This Friday,
I'm reallocating capital at the firm.

195
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,320
If you change strategies,

196
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:14,155
if you stray from the fundamentals,

197
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:16,918
I'll see it, so don't.

198
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:20,774
Position sizing, focus, restraint...

199
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:23,664
consider them our load-bearing walls.

200
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,932
And, uh, oh, yeah, do your best.

201
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,201
For you.

202
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,970
To return to Coach Wooden,

203
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:31,538
"You're the only one who
knows whether you've won."

204
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,477
Pretty sure the guy carving
up our trading dollars

205
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,146
knows whether we've won.

206
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:41,249
Was he looking at me when he said
"Barcalounger?"

207
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:43,751
Quarter ends Friday.

208
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,187
If you fuck up, it'll be locked in,

209
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,388
and you'll be locked out.

210
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,956
What if you fuck up?

211
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,025
Then wake the hell up
from your nightmare

212
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,594
'cause in this life,
I don't ever fuck up.

213
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:01,369
I know you don't want me here.

214
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:03,470
Got that right.

215
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,582
Book a room at the Yale
Club for my father.

216
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,817
Mr. Allard needs you.

217
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,522
Have you decided who
gets Sacker's office yet?

218
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:23,857
Bureau chiefs have been eyeing it.

219
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,529
That's Graceland, we're not touching it.

220
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:35,169
Good. I need ya.

221
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:36,437
No, you need Marie Kondo.

222
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,039
Jesus Christ.

223
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:40,875
You got Aaron Burr's
gun permit lost in here?

224
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:42,477
But let me guess,
you know where everything is,

225
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,011
down to the last carbon.

226
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,346
Nope. Not a clue.

227
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:48,049
Where are we on the
prosecutions Sacker left behind?

228
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:50,051
Flailing, Chuck.

229
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:52,815
I have to admit,
I'm not as savvy on the legal stuff

230
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,094
as certain other aspects of the job.

231
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:56,224
Like this one.

232
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:59,820
Big seafood wholesaler.
Mislabeled half its product,

233
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:01,739
stuck people with cheaper fish instead.

234
00:11:01,774 --> 00:11:03,602
The seafood fraud case,
we need a win on that.

235
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:05,552
To stand with the consumers
who're being fleeced.

236
00:11:05,587 --> 00:11:07,857
Well, we may need
a different opposing counsel.

237
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:10,037
Lady's a pit bull, won't settle it out.

238
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,839
Even though we got her dead to rights.

239
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:15,209
I see that you did need me. Okay.

240
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:18,279
- I'll handle it.
- Good.

241
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:20,548
But that's not why I needed ya.

242
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:23,117
Last night,
in a private suite at the Garden,

243
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,053
a young woman walks up
to Governor Sweeney,

244
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:27,855
told him he's wrecking
the Empire State...

245
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:31,025
- Hmm.
- ...and not that nicely.

246
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:32,093
People heard it.

247
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:35,230
My sources tell me it was Gail Prince.

248
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:37,331
- Mike Prince's...
- Oh, I know who she is.

249
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,966
Governor Sweeney still doesn't.

250
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:44,005
Buffalo Bob finds that out,
he's gonna get ornery.

251
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:45,540
Page Six. Call over there and...

252
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:47,241
That I know how to do.

253
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:48,543
This'll be sweet.

254
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:50,211
As a Coolatta with extra syrup.

255
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:52,947
The Commission never
awards the Games to a place

256
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,882
it doesn't feel completely welcome in.

257
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,083
So...

258
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,485
This should pretty much lead to the end

259
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:59,152
of Mike Prince's Olympic bid.

260
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,164
Don't call my mom till I can explain...

261
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,599
Mom already got the call.

262
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,037
Let's get Kate Sacker in here.

263
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,039
First, I'd like to get
Philip Charyn out of here,

264
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,774
and understand how he even got in.

265
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,409
It was no setup. I looked at the resumes

266
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,110
the headhunter sent blind.

267
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,845
Who else has that many
degrees from Stanford,

268
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,949
and Yale and Chicago? You knew.

269
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:30,084
You kept your nephew out of
the Prince Companies for years.

270
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,885
I win this round.

271
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,163
- Hey.
- Hey.

272
00:12:48,002 --> 00:12:50,104
Philip is Scooter's sister's kid.

273
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:52,573
Managed $300 million
in tech at his last firm.

274
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,308
Prince bought out his contract.

275
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,611
That means he'll get a big
hunk of our allocations.

276
00:12:56,644 --> 00:12:58,346
And our comp.

277
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:01,415
Don Fanucci's nephew's
not touching my smock.

278
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,612
For the record, offer me a basket

279
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:04,952
of fruit and veggies, I'm taking it.

280
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,516
Keep up the bucket shop
bullshit and you'll need it.

281
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:09,790
Mike said no changing strategies.

282
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,727
Too bad for you,
that means losing ones too.

283
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,730
Oh, no fucking way
I get bounced over you.

284
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:19,467
Guys, since "sincerity" is the mortar

285
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,803
that holds the "team spirit"
and "loyalty" blocks together,

286
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:25,439
maybe we share information.

287
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,409
Best practices?

288
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:30,811
What is this Commie shit,
from Mao's Little Red Book?

289
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:33,447
It's from the pyramid.

290
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,948
On the fridge?

291
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,858
Biggest hurdle we're facing,
Governor Sweeney.

292
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:46,227
The International
Commission of Sport is shy,

293
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,895
won't go where it's not wanted.
Never does.

294
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,063
Which is why you'll win him over

295
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:50,864
in the meeting I've set for you.

296
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:54,702
Yeah, I work quick.

297
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:56,203
It's what you brought me in for.

298
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,872
I need to know what to expect

299
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:00,775
from Chuck Rhoades
by way of interference.

300
00:14:00,808 --> 00:14:02,309
I could use you on the floor.

301
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,111
To clarify reallocation.

302
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,580
- I was perfectly clear.
- As Baccarat crystal.

303
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,282
What I really need is a referee.

304
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:11,118
It's a captain's practice, Wags.
Work it out.

305
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,396
I thought you were a vegan.

306
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,998
It's true what they say,
"Never work for your heroes."

307
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:37,144
Nope. All of it is vegan. Flatware too.

308
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,080
Terravore, the plant-based meat company,

309
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:40,581
just rolled up six
other vegan innovators.

310
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:42,383
We're buying in.

311
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,418
Um, the fork thing's super cool,
but Terravore's

312
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,554
kind of a big fat yawn
in the plant-based space.

313
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:50,311
India alone discards 120
billion plastic utensils a year.

314
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:52,718
- The market potential's robust.
- The forks aren't.

315
00:14:52,753 --> 00:14:54,907
Millet's pretty breakable,
so pricey to ship.

316
00:14:54,942 --> 00:14:56,430
Everybody's allocation's up for grabs.

317
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:59,467
This is the week to be
ruthlessly strategic.

318
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,901
Here's the strategy,

319
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,703
We calculate the largest position

320
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,705
we can buy in Terravore, then we buy it.

321
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,383
Governor thing just got a lot harder.

322
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,696
New York Post says Gail
insulted him to his face.

323
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:21,177
Practically spit in it.

324
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,672
- My Gail?
- Sorry to say.

325
00:15:22,707 --> 00:15:23,757
It's what I came to tell you.

326
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:24,959
Your meeting with him is off,

327
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:27,194
unless Gail plans to
be there to apologize

328
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,764
and then to publicly
recant to the paper.

329
00:15:29,797 --> 00:15:32,099
Get him on the phone.

330
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,301
He's not going to take my call, is he?

331
00:15:40,293 --> 00:15:42,109
Gail, it's Dad. Call me back.

332
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,311
- I'll reach her. Just, uh...
- She might take my call.

333
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,280
Not your job.

334
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:51,452
I just needed you to see me
on your call sheet today.

335
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:54,755
To know I'm with you,
regardless of who isn't.

336
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,791
"Rich Kid Schools Gov."

337
00:15:56,824 --> 00:15:59,093
Prince family punchline.

338
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,695
Monologue jokes can't
be far fucking behind.

339
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,297
Allow me to suggest the proper tonic...

340
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:08,320
a restorative trip to Lake Placid.

341
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:11,572
And the state debt incurred
during those Games.

342
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:12,940
Why is she lashing out at me?

343
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,141
Maybe because she actually...

344
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,709
just goin' out on a limb here...

345
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,545
has a problem with the governor.

346
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:19,179
At the exact moment I'm
wooing him for the Games?

347
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,383
I say hear her out.

348
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,319
She'd have to pick up
the phone for that.

349
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,788
I'm calling a family summit.
I need you to fly in

350
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,123
to help the conversation flow and...

351
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,991
You need me to help get Gail there,

352
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,126
that's what you need.

353
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,328
- Thank you. Yes.
- I can't.

354
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:37,164
I'm packing for a different summit,
Lizard Head Peak.

355
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,999
It's only a five-day window,
and not even you

356
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,668
can raise the temperature
by ten degrees.

357
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:42,937
Our daughter just jacked it
up by a lot more than that.

358
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,138
I need everyone there so I can lower it.

359
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:48,209
She gets it from you, y'know.

360
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:51,151
Not cowed by power, or anything, really.

361
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:52,046
I'm sending a plane.

362
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,781
You'll be on Lizard Head
before the anvil hits.

363
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:55,049
And if I drop everything for you,

364
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:56,216
what does that say to the kids?

365
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,854
It says you're strong enough
not to stand on ceremony.

366
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:05,866
We're 5X in Terravore now.
And we were noisy.

367
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,233
The Street knows we're all-in.

368
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:08,362
Good. What about the call options?

369
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,406
We're out of the money.
Like, way, way out.

370
00:17:10,441 --> 00:17:11,766
$20 above current price.

371
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:13,550
- Also good.
- Why's it good?

372
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:14,702
These calls expire in weeks,

373
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:17,102
worthless if we don't hit the target,
which we won't.

374
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:18,672
Either you know something we don't,

375
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,008
or you're shoving a wrench
into the gears as payback

376
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,711
for Prince gutting
the Africa Wi-Fi play.

377
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:25,112
My buy raised a red flag

378
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,814
because it's not customary for me,

379
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:28,349
so you're here to wag a finger.

380
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,117
But I'm comfortable with my decision.

381
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,685
You can carry on with your day.

382
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,187
Preempting me,

383
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,755
satisfying as it may be for you,

384
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,024
doesn't change my warning.

385
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,593
There is no bumping the pinball machine

386
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,262
at Michael Prince Capital.

387
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:42,396
Unh.

388
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,031
Don't do that.

389
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,399
But he's right.

390
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:47,434
You're trading this stock
as if you know something you shouldn't.

391
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,336
And I won't be the only one
who sees this, which is why

392
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,071
he dragged me in here even
though I have better shit to do.

393
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,506
And if there is a bump.

394
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,174
Mnh.

395
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:56,343
It carries criminal penalties.

396
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:59,013
Not a bump or a nudge
or a kick to the coin box.

397
00:17:59,046 --> 00:18:00,837
I believe in the company.

398
00:18:01,301 --> 00:18:03,383
Then I believe I'll be watching.

399
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,101
Less imposing than I expected.

400
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,670
That's the thing about
government offices.

401
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:25,430
The power comes from the man,
not the trappings.

402
00:18:25,465 --> 00:18:27,941
What makes you think I'm
talking about the trappings?

403
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:32,179
Ms. Mahar,

404
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,181
- or may I call you Daevisha?
- Call me Dave.

405
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:35,349
It's good enough for Starbucks...

406
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,284
Dave, you can drop the posturing.

407
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,320
Your client's guilty,
of literal bait-and-switch.

408
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:42,156
I can assure you,
what's good enough for Starbucks

409
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:43,757
isn't good enough for
the people of this state.

410
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,793
They want their fish called
by their proper names.

411
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:47,394
Absolutely.

412
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,096
There's no light between our positions.

413
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,732
Well,
other than the sweet burden of proof.

414
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:53,366
Which you bear.

415
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:56,804
You know, I read about you,
and I expected...

416
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:58,172
Someone subservient?

417
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,773
- No. A better person.
- Oh.

418
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,176
Former public defender,
first-generation American,

419
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:04,545
defending predatory rip-offs?

420
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:06,613
You left out a couple
of things on my resume.

421
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,381
Like Harvard Law, my Fulbright,

422
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,783
and the fact that I've
never lost a case.

423
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,219
Oh, I know. I called around, too.

424
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,388
You used to be a killer for our side.

425
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:17,550
Now you're like those guys Erin
Brockovich served water to.

426
00:19:17,585 --> 00:19:20,053
Difference is,
I'd know she was bluffing,

427
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:22,162
and I'd drink it down. Glug glug glug.

428
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,598
Well, the difference is,
I'm not bluffing.

429
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:26,500
I'll be trying this case
if it goes to court.

430
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:27,968
No one else.

431
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,939
I have a mountain of DNA evidence.

432
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:34,842
I'm Lancey Howard with the
jack of diamonds in his hand.

433
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,444
Then it's a good thing no one
plays five card stud anymore.

434
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,747
I'm twice as ready as the Kid, anyway.

435
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:41,782
I'm stoked to go against you.

436
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:43,250
Excuse me?

437
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:44,818
Last prosecutor of your vintage

438
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,353
who stepped into court,

439
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,222
ended up with hair dye
streaming down his face

440
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:51,558
like the tears of the clown that he is.

441
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:07,574
Do I look that focused?

442
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,843
I am that focused,

443
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,412
I just don't look it.

444
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,252
New guy.

445
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:19,520
You chose the wrong desk.

446
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:20,554
Oh, is that so?

447
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:22,983
Yeah, we go by Sharpe ratios here.

448
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:24,358
Highest performers on the left.

449
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,492
Oh.

450
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:30,864
My risk-adjusted return, I'm a 1.9.

451
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,066
So I could take yours.

452
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:33,600
But I was being polite.

453
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,404
What are we measuring next?

454
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:50,918
Patty of the week!

455
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:52,319
Mmm.

456
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,922
Good-looking chunk of chuck.

457
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:57,490
Blind tasting, here we go.

458
00:20:58,725 --> 00:20:59,860
Mmm.

459
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:05,632
Nice bite and mouth-feel.

460
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:08,602
Good fat content and bun-to-patty.

461
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:12,606
I like American cheese on a burger,
this is cheddar.

462
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,441
Medium juicy.

463
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:18,827
Rating is, a strong buy.

464
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:19,913
Where's this from?

465
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,582
New place from a
graduate of Corner Bistro.

466
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,085
Nice.

467
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,187
Well, there you have it.

468
00:21:28,445 --> 00:21:29,590
Sounded like he liked it.

469
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,492
The more he likes them,
the harder he throws them.

470
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:33,360
Another strong buy

471
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:34,828
for all my Russakoff's
Raiders out there:

472
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,196
ArpCom.

473
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:38,631
It is ready to rip!

474
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:47,474
Why would you watch him?

475
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:49,776
Even competent day traders
rarely make gains.

476
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,545
He is not competent.

477
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:56,016
Russakoff's the fucking man
to like millions of bros.

478
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,217
You're not one, though, so...

479
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,553
Not the man or not a bro?

480
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:01,321
If you were either, you wouldn't ask.

481
00:22:02,491 --> 00:22:03,957
He watches because
Russakoff moves the market

482
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,126
when he gets passionate.
It's a fact we don't like,

483
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,829
but a legit data point nonetheless.

484
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:09,963
Now. Can we talk Terravore?

485
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,532
Our buy inched it up to $63.00.

486
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:12,699
Yay, team.

487
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:15,269
That's still a far climb to $75.00.

488
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:16,770
The day traders just buy
what he tells them?

489
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:19,273
From the depths of their man caves,
they do.

490
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:20,774
And not just stonks.

491
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:24,177
He's a lifestyle brand unto himself.

492
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:37,758
Made the kids dinner.

493
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,493
You're welcome.

494
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,929
You're supposed to be at the Yale Club.

495
00:22:41,962 --> 00:22:44,064
Times like this, a man belongs

496
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:46,166
in the bosom of his family.

497
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,268
Grab yourself a lowball.

498
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:50,637
Everything we need is right here.

499
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:55,075
Have you even tried to call Roxanne?

500
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:57,077
Tendered an apology?

501
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,612
I called Judith

502
00:22:58,645 --> 00:23:00,514
to be sure

503
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,816
that I hadn't crossed any lines.

504
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,885
Well, having to check
is usually a great sign.

505
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:06,945
She assured me I hadn't.

506
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,222
One call down, one to go.

507
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:10,913
But we got to talking.

508
00:23:10,948 --> 00:23:14,027
And the bons mots were flying, Sonny,

509
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,431
like the Algonquin in '23.

510
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:20,200
I'm thinking of acting on our kinship,

511
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,035
of consummating it.

512
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,637
- She's game...
- Dad, no.

513
00:23:26,543 --> 00:23:28,208
What happens when this fling ends,

514
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,110
like all the others?

515
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:33,847
And you've bulldozed your
second home in as many years?

516
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,549
It's not like I haven't
thought this through.

517
00:23:37,284 --> 00:23:39,719
There is a plan B.

518
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,075
Uh.

519
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,249
You texted "Emergency with your dad."

520
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,585
He seems... fine.

521
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:14,330
I appreciate like hell you showing up.

522
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:16,589
You gotta talk to him.
You're the only one who can.

523
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:22,629
- Issue?
- He's forgotten he's married.

524
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:25,065
No. No.

525
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:29,970
You work him through whatever
stage life crisis this is.

526
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:31,738
I help my guys at work.

527
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:34,341
Our kids.
Maybe now finally myself, if I can.

528
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:37,144
I came because I thought "emergency"

529
00:24:37,177 --> 00:24:38,779
meant something different.

530
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,247
Fine by me.

531
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,682
Never got to unpack.

532
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:48,522
He's living here now?

533
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:51,191
Ergo, the emergency.

534
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:53,327
You can go back to your...

535
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,894
ever-expanding empire.

536
00:24:57,197 --> 00:24:59,232
I'm not gonna talk to you
about Kate Sacker, either.

537
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:01,301
I didn't say a word about her.

538
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,003
Even though she was poached,

539
00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:05,962
casus belli, a Cold War
thrust in the fucking broiler.

540
00:25:05,997 --> 00:25:07,641
I don't owe you an apology,
if that's what you're...

541
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:10,449
Oh, no, I hold Prince
responsible for that, not you.

542
00:25:10,484 --> 00:25:13,199
You just lured her
to his temple of greed.

543
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:15,749
- It's not Axe Capital, Chuck.
- It's worse.

544
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:17,851
Because it pretends to be better.

545
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:19,386
She's very special.

546
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:22,322
And special to me.

547
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,524
Don't ruin her, Wendy.

548
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:33,333
Sweeney's hitting back.

549
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:36,370
He ordered a fresh audit of
the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics,

550
00:25:36,403 --> 00:25:38,038
which went 320% over budget.

551
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:39,806
That's 'cause they were
run by resort town hacks.

552
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,475
State's still paying the damn bills.

553
00:25:41,508 --> 00:25:42,509
It's a low-grade stunt.

554
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,211
If Sweeney takes it public,

555
00:25:44,244 --> 00:25:45,345
it'll scare off the Commission.

556
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:46,513
Our bid'll be finished.

557
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:47,714
If we were willing to consider

558
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:49,816
in a carefully-worded statement,

559
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,251
putting some space between you
and your daughter on her...

560
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:52,586
We're unwilling.

561
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:53,854
I'm aware that that option is no fun,

562
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,856
but if you paid me to create fun,

563
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,758
I'd have replaced the
stairs with a water slide.

564
00:25:57,791 --> 00:26:00,393
- I'm here to get you the Games...
- Do it another way.

565
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:08,335
Afraid we need a little sit-down.

566
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:09,736
- What's the beef over?
- Gold.

567
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:11,371
- He's long, she's short.
- Details.

568
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:12,806
Not fucking tattling.

569
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,374
- We'll work it out.
- There, you see.

570
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,176
Before or after your stupid position

571
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:17,911
costs the firm bags o' cash?

572
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:22,194
I meant we're gonna close
out your dumb fucking shorts

573
00:26:22,229 --> 00:26:23,150
before gold soars.

574
00:26:23,183 --> 00:26:25,785
This is when they need to go
to the principal's office.

575
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,043
I don't know enough yet
to weigh in on any of this.

576
00:26:30,078 --> 00:26:31,258
And I'm not inclined to do the work

577
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:33,426
to figure it out just now.

578
00:26:35,937 --> 00:26:37,964
Can you give us the room?

579
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,768
Kate, you too.

580
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,507
One, Sacker's right
about that statement.

581
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,442
You should issue it.

582
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:51,678
Two, you don't know enough
yet to make a determination?

583
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:53,847
If this situation with
Gail is taking you...

584
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,182
Bonnie's short is 88%
negatively correlated,

585
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,685
Victor's calls expire in six days,

586
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:00,020
three-and-a-half hours...

587
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:02,755
I'm the Eye of Sauron, I see all.

588
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,726
But my communication
with my daughter has gone

589
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:09,462
from a trickle to dead silence.

590
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,331
The floor, the Commission,

591
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:13,799
that's the easy stuff.

592
00:27:24,187 --> 00:27:25,745
In my, uh,

593
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:27,580
prior employment situation

594
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:29,315
with He Whom I Shall Not Mention...

595
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:30,750
Good policy.

596
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:33,819
Yeah. With him and the others there...

597
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:36,289
I could guide them

598
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,058
because there were specific guard rails,

599
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:39,826
things you can or cannot
do from those offices.

600
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:42,495
Expectations. Limits.

601
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:45,015
Even when stretched,
you kind of knew the contours.

602
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,500
Hmm. Billionaires are
not public servants.

603
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:48,868
The levers are different.

604
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:50,804
Huh.

605
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:53,139
Does it ever get any easier,

606
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,974
seeing exactly what
they should do, and...

607
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,076
not being able to get them to do it?

608
00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:02,248
What'll happen is,

609
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,417
you'll just direct it
more and more inwardly

610
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,052
until you stop serving them.

611
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,888
When you're ready.

612
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:13,359
Or you'll get out of it all entirely.

613
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:14,461
That what you're doing?

614
00:28:14,494 --> 00:28:16,696
Me? No.

615
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:20,700
No, I'm thinking about
incorporating all of it.

616
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:24,070
Synthesizing. Letting go of results.

617
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:25,371
Breathing.

618
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,040
Ah, the Eastern approach.

619
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:28,308
Absolutely.

620
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:30,676
But the old habits.

621
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,780
- I have this guy...
- A guy?

622
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:38,051
No, not like that. A priest. Buddhist.

623
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:40,386
He's helping me take refuge.

624
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,555
I tried to um, like...

625
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:44,858
bribe him.

626
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:46,960
I didn't even realize I was doing it.

627
00:28:46,993 --> 00:28:49,724
Shit. You get lost like that,

628
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:52,232
- how's a naif like me supposed to...
- Oh, hardly.

629
00:28:52,265 --> 00:28:54,534
You've been balancing these equities,

630
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:55,769
the inner and the outer,

631
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:58,471
for most of your life.

632
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:00,473
I like the Bodhisattva way.

633
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:02,008
Don't worry about yourself.
Enlighten others.

634
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,644
That's my vibe. But, mmm...

635
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:08,047
not trying to hang onto it
as tight as it seems you are.

636
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,082
I'm definitely not bribing any Brahman.

637
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:14,687
I imagine if you did,
they wouldn't see it coming.

638
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,063
So?

639
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,099
Sweeney wants to meet with me.

640
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:28,568
About Mike Prince's Olympic bid.
Barely had to raise it.

641
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,904
Feels like we got a little
breeze at our backsides.

642
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:33,706
Or maybe it's the Lake Placid windchill.

643
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:34,874
Where are we on an expert witness

644
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:36,609
for my seafood fraud trial?

645
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:39,212
I've reached out to some
of the better fish DNA guys.

646
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,881
Not better. Best.

647
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:44,717
The testimony in this
case is everything.

648
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,653
Needs to be devastating. Undeniable.

649
00:29:46,686 --> 00:29:48,922
Best guy's named Bowen,
but he's not available.

650
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:51,991
Locked up in cases
with other prosecutors.

651
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,827
You sure Dave didn't
get him on their behalf?

652
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,528
Yeah. He's not an industry guy.

653
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:56,830
He's state's expert.

654
00:29:56,863 --> 00:29:58,865
No, I still smell Dave here.

655
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:00,500
She made sure this Bowen was busy.

656
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:02,035
Shouldn't matter.

657
00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:04,337
The other three experts
are raring to go.

658
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,872
This is Dave Mahar.

659
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:07,707
I'm sure of it.

660
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,976
She's trying to cut my damn
legs out from under me.

661
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,778
You get to this Bowen and let him know,

662
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:13,346
he testifies in this trial for us,

663
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:15,849
he gets me this win, or he never gets

664
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:18,651
hired by any state again.

665
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:19,853
Why's this one matter so much?

666
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:22,822
She called me, in so many words,

667
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:25,725
"A Giuliani-level hack."

668
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:28,061
That's Clubber Lang telling
Adrian he's more man than Rocky.

669
00:30:28,094 --> 00:30:30,763
I have a moral and
professional obligation

670
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:33,265
to knock her the fuck out now.

671
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:40,073
I'm gonna be flushed with
the bottom ten percent,

672
00:30:40,106 --> 00:30:41,758
like G.E. did every year.

673
00:30:41,793 --> 00:30:43,509
I'm gonna be G.E.'d.

674
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,411
Lot of people here.

675
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:48,348
Someone's gotta be doing worse than you.

676
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:50,283
Okay, that didn't come out the way I...

677
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:53,086
I'm gonna ask for less
assets under management.

678
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,121
If I'm smaller, more concentrated,

679
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:57,123
I can carve a corridor
to a bigger profit share.

680
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:59,158
No. You never ask for less.

681
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,827
They'll think something's
wrong with you,

682
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,361
maybe even fire you on principle.

683
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:06,432
I'm gonna be G.E.'d.

684
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:14,007
It says, "Use the threading
wire to pull it through,

685
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,742
then remove and discard it."

686
00:31:15,775 --> 00:31:17,277
I already removed and discarded it.

687
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,012
There was nothing to pull through.

688
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:21,447
'Cause you removed and discarded it!

689
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:26,318
Look, if ya came to play,
the tourney's been delayed.

690
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,439
I need your help on a
different kind of play.

691
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:48,007
A business play.

692
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:51,443
Why us?

693
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:54,146
Let me tell ya, bro.

694
00:31:57,717 --> 00:32:00,520
I know exactly what you're
doing with Terravore.

695
00:32:00,553 --> 00:32:02,055
Trying to pick a winner
in a fast-growing sector.

696
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:03,423
Trying to get it added.

697
00:32:03,456 --> 00:32:05,124
To boost its price and
market cap by enough

698
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:07,260
that it's added to the S&P 500.

699
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:09,329
When it is, all the index funds
are forced to buy in,

700
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:11,297
that's the rule.
Which pumps the stock even more,

701
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,299
and you can dump it before it cools.

702
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,601
Good read.

703
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,570
But, like I told you,
I believe in the company.

704
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:20,773
Without documentation,
it's market manipulation.

705
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:22,175
I prosecuted people for this.

706
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,277
You sound like Spyros.
Assertion without proof.

707
00:32:24,894 --> 00:32:27,280
Here's what the SEC's gonna ask:

708
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:29,515
"Where the fuck is your proof?"

709
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:33,619
♪ Here I am ♪

710
00:32:34,754 --> 00:32:37,156
♪ On the road again... ♪

711
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,026
Biscuits and gravy.

712
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,962
Dad, I gotta throw a flag on this one.

713
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:45,398
Illegal emotional manipulation.

714
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:47,834
Totally unfair for us
to have to smell that

715
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:48,868
as we walk into the apartment.

716
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:50,470
Also, it's not gonna work.

717
00:32:50,503 --> 00:32:52,238
Bob Seger's a nice touch, though.

718
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,483
Reminds me of Sundays
when the kids were little.

719
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:56,476
What? You think I would plan this out?

720
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:58,978
I think you told your staff
to let you know the minute

721
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:01,514
we got in the elevator so the chorus
of "Turn the Page"

722
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:04,119
would hit exactly when we
walked into the kitchen.

723
00:33:04,154 --> 00:33:06,552
Would I be the guy you
married if I hadn't?

724
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:09,956
I just so happened to
have a mix from Rosie's.

725
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,324
They sent over a care package.

726
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:13,159
After you sent the plane for it, M-Tap?

727
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:15,294
I can't... Yeah, who can remember?

728
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,030
The point is, we're having some

729
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:19,165
homemade Indiana biscuits and gravy.

730
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:21,134
Dad, we were summoned.

731
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,869
I mean, I'm not gonna refuse the food

732
00:33:22,902 --> 00:33:24,470
because we all know I'm not...

733
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,805
I am refusing.

734
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,740
I'm not breaking bread
with him at this point.

735
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:29,642
Yeah, honestly,

736
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,144
we're still pissed.

737
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:32,912
You don't get to police our emotions.

738
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:34,514
Especially about your bullshit.

739
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:38,418
I just told them to go at it straight.

740
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:39,752
Good. Yes.

741
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:41,354
Let's get into it.

742
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:43,189
Because I-I can't live with things being

743
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:45,892
catawampus like this between us anymore.

744
00:33:45,925 --> 00:33:47,727
You're right. I was not

745
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,296
entirely forthright about
the cannabis company thing.

746
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:53,140
Forthright?
So you're a soft peddler now.

747
00:33:53,175 --> 00:33:54,634
You'd rather I be as direct as you were

748
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:56,069
with Governor Sweeney?

749
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:57,804
She was right to say what she said.

750
00:33:57,837 --> 00:34:00,073
She may have been,
but it doesn't mean she had to say it.

751
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:03,242
- You're on his side?
- I'm on all your sides.

752
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:05,244
There's... there's no sides.

753
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:07,046
I mean, there's...
there's one damn side.

754
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,182
I mean, Gail and I are kind of a side,

755
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:11,216
and you're usually on it.

756
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:14,420
What your sister said put a
lot of pressure on your dad

757
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:16,722
when he's trying to
accomplish a difficult...

758
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:19,225
really hard... thing.

759
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:21,928
- It means a hell of a lot.
- To you and him.

760
00:34:22,498 --> 00:34:25,326
Because if he locks this down,
you get a thing, too.

761
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:27,600
We all get a thing,
right, when I do well?

762
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:29,535
All the things.

763
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,604
That's the first time

764
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:34,722
you've ever said anything like that.

765
00:34:34,757 --> 00:34:37,076
We're all grownups here now, aren't we?

766
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,145
So let's not leave it unsaid.

767
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:42,415
You're both billionaires, or you will be

768
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:44,650
partially because of all
the times I held my tongue

769
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:46,619
and didn't tell someone
what I actually thought.

770
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:48,488
You made more doing the opposite.

771
00:34:48,521 --> 00:34:50,289
The gift you've given us is,

772
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:52,691
"Have no fear about speaking our minds."

773
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:56,161
That's right. Good.

774
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,699
But, uh,

775
00:34:59,732 --> 00:35:02,034
sometimes, even though we don't have

776
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:04,203
the traditional things to lose,

777
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:05,404
we still have a lot to lose.

778
00:35:06,524 --> 00:35:08,608
What are you asking her to do?

779
00:35:08,641 --> 00:35:10,443
Apologize. Tell the governor

780
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:11,511
you didn't mean it. Tell him...

781
00:35:11,552 --> 00:35:13,412
- Jesus Christ.
- Fuck that.

782
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,914
- Girls!
- I can't apologize

783
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,282
for telling the truth. I won't.

784
00:35:19,185 --> 00:35:21,186
Then your dad'll never make you.

785
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,324
I'll say I'm sorry, too,

786
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:27,527
for the way I handled
the business thing.

787
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,195
I should have brought you inside it.

788
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,198
Still not going to do what you want.

789
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,003
Okay.

790
00:35:37,036 --> 00:35:38,604
I wish you would.

791
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,206
But... okay.

792
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:46,612
Will you at least start
answering my texts, then?

793
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:49,649
We'll put you back on the family thread.

794
00:35:49,682 --> 00:35:52,752
Oh, I-I'm already on the family thread.

795
00:35:52,785 --> 00:35:54,921
We might've, um,

796
00:35:54,954 --> 00:35:57,857
already started a new one.

800
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,371
Now, Mr. Bowen,

801
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:15,197
as an expert witness, you have testified

802
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,210
that the goods from
Ocean's Plenty Wholesalers

803
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:18,511
were not as claimed,

804
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:21,447
but rather cheap, garbage fish,

805
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,816
mislabeled and pawned off
on an unwitting public.

806
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,318
I'm afraid so, yes.

807
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,086
In my expert opinion.

808
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,754
I object. Leading question.

809
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,856
- Overruled.
- But, Judge...

810
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,658
Ms. Mahar, didn't you see

811
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,894
A Few Good Men during law school?

812
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:36,896
You're about to get the judge
to reaffirm my guy's an expert.

813
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:40,266
Judge, I have something to say
about the bias...

814
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:41,667
You'll have your chance

815
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,369
to cross-examine the expert witness.

816
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:45,438
Ah! See that?

817
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:47,206
And not only is he an expert,

818
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,374
he's a scientist

819
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:50,676
whose bias is the truth.

820
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,279
Something your client the conglomerate

821
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:56,749
tried to hide to rake in more profit.

822
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:58,551
Ocean's Plenty

823
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:00,586
trampled the rules with abandon.

824
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:03,522
Duped customers day after day,

825
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,592
resulting in millions in largesse.

826
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:10,262
No further questions.

827
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:14,600
Your moment's arrived, counsel.

828
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,504
So, who paid you to be here today?

829
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:20,506
The State of New York.

830
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,275
They hired me to gather
all the evidence in this case.

831
00:37:22,308 --> 00:37:24,343
The State of New York.

832
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:25,678
Just laying out the truth for the State.

833
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:28,914
Then, which do you prefer, meat or fish?

834
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:32,084
Or grain? Or dairy?

835
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:34,787
Objection. Relevance.
We're not planning menus...

836
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,323
If there's a point,
counsel, get to it fast.

837
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:40,159
The point is bias.

838
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:42,128
If he loves meat and hates fish...

839
00:37:42,161 --> 00:37:44,096
it's hard to give a fishmonger
a break, isn't it?

840
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:47,599
Sure, I like meat.

841
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,169
I like fish too.

842
00:37:50,202 --> 00:37:51,637
I like grain, bread, whatever.

843
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,306
What does that have to do with...

844
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,841
Permission to approach the witness.

845
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:58,511
Recognize those?

846
00:37:58,544 --> 00:38:00,279
You're under oath here.

847
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:01,681
- I'm aware of that...
- Good,

848
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:04,083
because if you are lying about anything,

849
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:05,885
it's a class-D felony.
There are grave penalties for...

850
00:38:05,918 --> 00:38:08,054
This is harassment, if she doesn't have

851
00:38:08,087 --> 00:38:09,655
an actual line of inquiry...

852
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:12,289
Protecting your witness from perjury,

853
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:13,392
I'd say that's an actual...

854
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:15,094
The witness knows the
penalty for perjury.

855
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,997
He's not an idiot,
and you're not even making a defense.

856
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,632
Since we understand

857
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:21,934
the severe penalties for perjury,

858
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,302
for you and your wife.

859
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:25,104
Those documents are IRS Form 990s...

860
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,339
Okay. All right.

861
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:29,975
I'm biased.

862
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:32,845
For... whoever is paying.

863
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:34,346
Yes.

864
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:42,688
Enter defense exhibit into evidence.

865
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:46,992
Multiple payments for $50,000

866
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,661
made out to his wife,

867
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:51,564
from big beef, big poultry, big dairy,

868
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:52,865
to hide the fact that he'll say

869
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:54,567
whatever his paymaster wants him to.

870
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,335
He's a paid gun for hire.

871
00:38:56,368 --> 00:38:58,571
Today it's for the state, tomorrow,

872
00:38:58,604 --> 00:39:00,306
whoever's got the next check.

873
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:04,443
Sir, you have the right not to
incriminate yourself further.

874
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:07,612
That count as a defense to you?

875
00:39:20,893 --> 00:39:22,728
You outplayed me.

876
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:25,564
Took a dirty witness off the board

877
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:28,501
so I'd insist on having him.

878
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:30,336
Till he tainted all my evidence.

879
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,806
Like that lousy fish you'd never eat.

880
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,510
You got that right.
Look at the bright side.

881
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:40,912
You got to log a few
hours in a courtroom.

882
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:56,128
Sorry for the drop-in.

883
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:58,964
I'll clear my schedule.

884
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:00,533
I need you to add to it.

885
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:02,535
A call with Governor Sweeney.

886
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:04,903
So I can apologize.

887
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:07,473
What made you change your mind?

888
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:09,909
I mean, you knew it would work on me.

889
00:40:09,942 --> 00:40:12,144
You're my fucking father.
And a good one.

890
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:14,280
I curse like four times a year.
Why do you have to...

891
00:40:14,313 --> 00:40:16,915
I went to college out of state.

892
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,986
Just get the phone. Let's call this guy.

893
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:26,659
Call the governor's office, tell him

894
00:40:26,692 --> 00:40:28,294
Gail wants to speak with him.

895
00:40:28,327 --> 00:40:29,862
You know what you want to say?

896
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:31,863
Think it through, don't freelance it.

897
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,768
So,

898
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:37,969
Mr. Sweeney... Mr. Governor...

899
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:42,507
about what I said the other...

900
00:40:44,076 --> 00:40:46,878
I'm so sorry for what
I said the other...

901
00:40:50,249 --> 00:40:51,517
Mr. Governor,

902
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,852
regardless of my feelings,

903
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:54,920
out of respect for your office,

904
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:57,189
what I said the other night was wrong,

905
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:58,924
and I am so sorry I...

906
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,625
Forget it.

907
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:05,164
You don't want me to apologize?

908
00:41:06,365 --> 00:41:07,633
I do want you to apologize.

909
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:09,802
I-I need you to, really.

910
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:12,505
But, uh...
I raised you to speak your mind.

911
00:41:12,538 --> 00:41:15,207
Fuck!

912
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,343
Five.

913
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:26,652
I'll tell you, Dad.

914
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:28,153
I will never understand

915
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:31,257
how a guy that thin-skinned
becomes governor.

916
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:34,326
Some kid gives him a little crap,

917
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:35,995
and he lets it shape policy?

918
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:37,596
I mean...

919
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:40,732
the vanity is just so over the top.

920
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,034
Good.

921
00:41:44,036 --> 00:41:45,871
Yeah.

922
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:46,938
Real good.

923
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,610
Terravore's still tickling $66.00.

924
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:57,182
This quarter's gonna be a bloodbath.

925
00:41:58,744 --> 00:42:00,953
I'm never gonna get a sheet of my own.

926
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:05,824
Hang on.

927
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,926
Russakoff has a new post...

928
00:42:09,061 --> 00:42:10,929
about Terravore.

929
00:42:14,266 --> 00:42:16,035
Mmm.

930
00:42:16,068 --> 00:42:18,870
Juicy, savory...

931
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,974
nice patty tension, good bite...

932
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:26,045
This is a top pick,

933
00:42:26,078 --> 00:42:27,580
outperform!

934
00:42:27,613 --> 00:42:30,616
Thi-this is a must-buy with leverage!

935
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:32,051
Where the hell did you get this from?

936
00:42:32,084 --> 00:42:34,787
It's Terravore. 100% vegan, plant-based.

937
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,622
You're fucking kidding me.

938
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:39,157
This is all shoots and leaves?

939
00:42:41,873 --> 00:42:43,629
Not the only way it's green.

940
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:45,464
Mase Carb's yay deep in this name.

941
00:42:45,497 --> 00:42:47,132
It's ready to hockey stick.

942
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,736
Nice, dude, didn't even see you

943
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:53,238
swap out the meat for the vegan shit.

944
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:55,774
I thought you were
gonna make the switch.

945
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:58,777
Raiders,

946
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:02,448
Terravore is ready to pull

947
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:04,216
a major stiffy!

948
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,051
Ohh!

949
00:43:12,491 --> 00:43:14,226
Taylor.

950
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,895
Stock's surging on message
boards and Robinhood.

951
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,298
- The brosephs are biting!
- Taylor.

952
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:21,934
And once momentum gets going
with the retail crowd...

953
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:23,168
Taylor.

954
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:25,738
So you keep saying. We should be happy.

955
00:43:26,741 --> 00:43:29,774
We had to game it all out
from a burger review.

956
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:41,286
They say the finest bespoke tailors

957
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:42,988
have "rock of eye."

958
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:46,358
Can see beyond pattern and chalk

959
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:49,628
to take someone's true measure
by instinct, expertise.

960
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:50,996
You think that's how I beat you?

961
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:52,865
No. It's how I see beyond the woman

962
00:43:52,898 --> 00:43:56,135
who stood up for an
indefensible seafood scam

963
00:43:56,168 --> 00:43:58,671
to the better person lurking beneath.

964
00:43:58,704 --> 00:44:00,039
I served my client.

965
00:44:00,072 --> 00:44:01,907
No higher calling for a lawyer.

966
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,008
But your professional background,

967
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:04,777
your choice of eatery, tells me

968
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:07,446
you're not meant to cut vicuna cloth

969
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:09,014
to pad your partners' paunches.

970
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:10,949
You're meant to fit the real villains

971
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,985
for orange fucking jumpsuits.

972
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:15,054
So you came here to yell at me.

973
00:44:15,087 --> 00:44:16,755
I came here...

974
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:20,325
to hire you.

975
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:22,561
I did my 20 years as a PD

976
00:44:22,594 --> 00:44:25,464
helping people with nothing
get their actual day in court.

977
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:27,366
I did.

978
00:44:27,399 --> 00:44:30,536
But eventually I wanted to
come home to a place I owned,

979
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:33,038
not one I shared with a bank.

980
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:35,541
So you went white shoe.

981
00:44:35,574 --> 00:44:36,909
It just became time to get paid

982
00:44:36,942 --> 00:44:38,243
commensurate with my abilities.

983
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,747
Good.

984
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,583
Good, now we're talking worth.

985
00:44:44,616 --> 00:44:47,252
'Cause those seven figures
may convince you of yours

986
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:50,022
and it'll feel fucking great,
for a while.

987
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:53,124
But it's a mirage and you know it.

988
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:56,729
The worth I can offer is 200 times

989
00:44:56,762 --> 00:44:58,897
the ski house that beckons

990
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,667
or the beach house that follows that.

991
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,203
There's a war going on,

992
00:45:04,236 --> 00:45:06,805
between the very wealth
you are trying to accrue

993
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:10,041
and the rest of us.
The stakes are absolute.

994
00:45:11,343 --> 00:45:13,212
And we are under-armed and under-manned,

995
00:45:13,245 --> 00:45:15,881
and you will be the difference maker,

996
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:19,084
which will make you feel
like yourself again.

997
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:20,251
Finally.

998
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:37,402
Good enough data to
divvy up the capital yet?

999
00:45:37,435 --> 00:45:39,271
Soon.

1000
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:41,573
Keep this going much longer,
they'll fuck the place up.

1001
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:43,142
Maybe.

1002
00:45:43,175 --> 00:45:45,110
But this place is also a platform

1003
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:48,080
for the bigger goals we're chasing.

1004
00:45:48,113 --> 00:45:50,582
Screw those up,
might as well not even be here.

1005
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:52,084
It all starts with the Games.

1006
00:45:52,117 --> 00:45:54,286
Then we need to look
at ways to hit Sweeney,

1007
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,188
before he meets with Rhoades tomorrow.

1008
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:59,291
Wags gave me a phone number
of a certain operative.

1009
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:02,127
Yeah, I don't think an assassination,

1010
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,429
virtual or literal,
is the way to go here.

1011
00:46:04,462 --> 00:46:06,899
No, I keep on thinking
about the vanity of a guy

1012
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:09,101
who would let a random
insult shape policy.

1013
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:10,702
Probably starts every book he reads

1014
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:12,137
at the index, under "Sweeney."

1015
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:17,129
Where are we on the naming
rights for the stadium?

1016
00:46:17,164 --> 00:46:18,644
We're taking offers.

1017
00:46:18,677 --> 00:46:19,811
Bidding's robust.

1018
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,148
Let's stop.

1019
00:46:28,386 --> 00:46:30,789
Russakoff's Raiders pushed it to 75,

1020
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:31,924
and the market cap
tipped it over the edge.

1021
00:46:31,957 --> 00:46:33,425
S&P 500 just announced.

1022
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,661
Terravore joins the index in two weeks.

1023
00:46:35,694 --> 00:46:36,995
Good. Sell the news.

1024
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:38,664
Blow it out, all of it.

1025
00:46:38,697 --> 00:46:40,465
You're not selling those calls.

1026
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:43,059
- Or a single share of the stock.
- We're in the money.

1027
00:46:43,094 --> 00:46:44,269
If I don't sell now,
they'll be worth nothing.

1028
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,138
If you do sell, it's manipulation.

1029
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:48,040
I'm backing Spyros on this.

1030
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,932
You have a problem with it too?

1031
00:46:49,967 --> 00:46:51,143
If an employee courts prosecution,

1032
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:53,478
we're in HR territory, so, yes.

1033
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:54,680
That won't be an issue.

1034
00:46:54,707 --> 00:46:56,381
Legal's been in on this from the start.

1035
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:57,482
I can paper this sale.

1036
00:46:59,251 --> 00:47:01,153
What do you have to support the buy?

1037
00:47:01,186 --> 00:47:04,189
- My gut. My brain.
- That won't be good enough.

1038
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,298
What if it is a bump?

1039
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,334
And I want to be the
pinball fucking wizard,

1040
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:17,869
right up to the tilt line
without setting it off?

1041
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:22,307
Hmm.

1042
00:47:23,575 --> 00:47:24,776
How long have you been vegan?

1043
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:26,244
Six and a half years.

1044
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:30,549
Well, that's six and a half
years of Instacart orders,

1045
00:47:30,582 --> 00:47:33,085
Amazon deliveries,
web searches for vegan products

1046
00:47:33,118 --> 00:47:35,220
that just became due diligence.

1047
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:38,189
And it's all gonna go
in an analyst's report.

1048
00:47:46,398 --> 00:47:48,267
For six and a half years now,

1049
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,435
Taylor has been meticulously
researching Terravore

1050
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:52,937
and the entire sector.

1051
00:47:53,905 --> 00:47:55,440
I'll hang onto that

1052
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:57,308
in case the SEC calls.

1053
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:08,353
You know what happened here.
On my watch.

1054
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:10,322
Under my nose.

1055
00:48:11,545 --> 00:48:13,225
I know what I think happened.

1056
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:16,027
I also know, no one can prove it.

1057
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:20,899
Blow it out. Sell all of it.

1058
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:32,010
This isn't what we talked about.

1059
00:48:32,936 --> 00:48:35,246
I'm an attorney Wendy, not a monk.

1060
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:37,282
Neither are you.

1061
00:48:55,834 --> 00:48:58,236
You think I'd be here if
I didn't look up to you?

1062
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:01,106
- You looked past me to Prince.
- He gets me.

1063
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:02,841
He thinks you're his
Rocking-Horse Winner.

1064
00:49:02,874 --> 00:49:04,009
Yeah, well, that guy never missed.

1065
00:49:04,042 --> 00:49:05,110
Until it killed him.

1066
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:07,211
It's just an old story.

1067
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:12,551
I could have been a conductor,
you know. For real.

1068
00:49:12,584 --> 00:49:14,820
Even at a young age,
I could hear when an orchestra

1069
00:49:14,853 --> 00:49:16,221
was really firing.

1070
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:18,290
When the oboist was hungover

1071
00:49:18,323 --> 00:49:22,094
or second chair violin was
getting over a heartache.

1072
00:49:22,127 --> 00:49:23,295
Couldn't pay for a ticket,

1073
00:49:23,328 --> 00:49:25,397
so I would go when the Phil

1074
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,132
piped the music out into Lincoln Center.

1075
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:29,500
Even though it was
noisy as hell outside...

1076
00:49:31,603 --> 00:49:33,438
I could hear it all.

1077
00:49:35,638 --> 00:49:37,642
But in the end, I chose money.
Simple as that.

1078
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:39,911
I met Prince,
saw where we could go together,

1079
00:49:39,944 --> 00:49:41,680
walked away from it.

1080
00:49:41,713 --> 00:49:43,531
So buy yourself an orchestra.
You can afford one now.

1081
00:49:43,566 --> 00:49:45,083
Yeah, sure. But I won't,

1082
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:47,819
because I'm a realist.

1083
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:50,555
What I'm telling you is,

1084
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:54,292
don't sell your private dreams
short for the more common one.

1085
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,194
What if they're one and the same?

1086
00:49:55,262 --> 00:49:57,629
Then you wouldn't have been
teaching in that charter school.

1087
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,898
You can be more than
a rich guy at a fund.

1088
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:02,285
You can be a founder, an operator.

1089
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,337
- Change the world.
- I know, Senator Corleone.

1090
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:08,106
- Governor Corleone.
- Yes. Exactly.

1091
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:13,011
If you could only see
yourself through my eyes...

1092
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:16,848
you'd know it's all possible.

1093
00:50:16,881 --> 00:50:19,251
Ain't that the human condition.

1094
00:50:19,284 --> 00:50:21,386
'Cause all I want is to be here.

1095
00:50:21,419 --> 00:50:24,256
And I want you to want me here, I do.

1096
00:50:24,289 --> 00:50:27,625
But if you don't... I'll be here anyway.

1097
00:50:34,482 --> 00:50:36,567
My dad sold insurance.

1098
00:50:37,393 --> 00:50:39,071
He always told me,

1099
00:50:39,104 --> 00:50:41,406
"Control what you can,

1100
00:50:41,439 --> 00:50:43,574
take out a policy on the rest."

1101
00:50:45,143 --> 00:50:47,145
Get a load of that.

1102
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:54,152
The real version will be up at
the opening ceremony in '28.

1103
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:57,121
If you help me get there.

1104
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:01,692
Well, uh...

1105
00:51:02,794 --> 00:51:04,196
why would I ever do that?

1106
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:06,598
Because legacies are tricky.

1107
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:08,266
You know, history controls them, not us.

1108
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:10,102
Yeah, well, mine's going to be tainted

1109
00:51:10,135 --> 00:51:11,703
by what your daughter said.

1110
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:15,073
- Newspapers already wrote that...
- Newspapers.

1111
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:18,376
They call 'em "history's first
rough draft" for a reason.

1112
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,212
Same reason the Irish
took 'em into the jacks

1113
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:22,447
before toilet paper.

1114
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,217
That's why I'm offering
you an insurance policy

1115
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,285
on your own history.

1116
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:35,791
Sweeney was supposed to
be here 30 minutes ago.

1117
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:38,162
- Where the hell is he?
- The meeting's off.

1118
00:51:39,564 --> 00:51:41,600
The governor's throwing in with Prince.

1119
00:51:41,633 --> 00:51:43,668
He's supporting the New York Games.

1120
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:45,536
Jeez Louise.

1121
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:54,446
I took my own measure today.

1122
00:51:54,479 --> 00:51:57,648
Rock of eye.
And I'm here to get what I'm worth.

1123
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:06,624
This woman, Judith...

1124
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:09,628
she was on my bucket list since

1125
00:52:09,661 --> 00:52:13,498
before either of us had even remarried.

1126
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:16,134
Yet here you are at Chuck's,
not acting on it.

1127
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:18,970
Just waiting.

1128
00:52:19,003 --> 00:52:22,140
And you're here to explain
why this restraint is good,

1129
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:24,609
why this is change.

1130
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:25,810
Nope.

1131
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:30,148
B.F. Skinner said
free will is an illusion;

1132
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:31,883
all we really have is
conditioning behavior

1133
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:33,418
and its consequences.

1134
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:36,354
And even the worst behavior, followed by

1135
00:52:36,387 --> 00:52:39,357
pleasant consequences,
is bound to be repeated.

1136
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:42,760
I've thought about that a lot this week.

1137
00:52:44,062 --> 00:52:47,065
So... I need to condition myself.

1138
00:52:47,098 --> 00:52:49,534
For the good.

1139
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:51,269
No. It's why you can't change.

1140
00:52:52,804 --> 00:52:56,407
You've only been rewarded
for bad behavior so...

1141
00:52:57,775 --> 00:53:00,278
you need to stay the
hell away from Roxanne.

1142
00:53:01,646 --> 00:53:02,680
Stay away?

1143
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,718
For her sake.

1144
00:53:06,751 --> 00:53:10,989
'Cause you're only gonna cheat
or fuck it up in some way.

1145
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:13,391
And she's only gonna suffer.

1146
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:30,875
He made up with her.
He's packing his bags to go home.

1147
00:53:32,908 --> 00:53:35,580
- How'd you do it?
- I urged him to stay away.

1148
00:53:35,613 --> 00:53:37,115
Naturally.

1149
00:53:37,148 --> 00:53:40,318
I knew you were gonna come back.

1150
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:42,821
The week I've had, I...

1151
00:53:42,854 --> 00:53:44,923
I wanted to help where I actually could.

1152
00:53:44,956 --> 00:53:47,659
Oh, please. You owed me one
after poaching Sacker.

1153
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:50,828
- Not the way I saw it.
- Uh-huh.

1154
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:56,267
Thank you anyway,
for hauling him outta here.

1155
00:54:20,792 --> 00:54:24,763
Daniel, I need to cancel
our meeting tonight.

1156
00:54:24,796 --> 00:54:27,999
I couldn't go the four days
without being transactional.

1157
00:54:28,032 --> 00:54:30,601
I couldn't go four hours.

1158
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:33,505
I'm gonna start over.

1159
00:54:33,538 --> 00:54:35,339
Call you when I get there.

1160
00:54:48,486 --> 00:54:50,522
Sometimes you cut someone's minutes

1161
00:54:50,555 --> 00:54:52,290
to remind them of their job.

1162
00:54:52,323 --> 00:54:54,159
Sometimes you sit down a starter

1163
00:54:54,192 --> 00:54:56,328
so they stand up stronger.

1164
00:54:56,361 --> 00:54:58,396
Wooden. Again.

1165
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:02,500
Now, no one's being fired.

1166
00:55:03,327 --> 00:55:05,937
This isn't Jack Welch's G.E.

1167
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:10,575
But too many of you were thrown
off your games too easily,

1168
00:55:10,608 --> 00:55:12,744
so not all of you are
gonna keep their minutes.

1169
00:55:12,777 --> 00:55:14,679
Victor, you'll keep all of yours.

1170
00:55:14,712 --> 00:55:16,481
You showed full exertion
and total focus,

1171
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:17,949
even in a petty squabble.

1172
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:20,051
But Philip's gonna clean up your book,

1173
00:55:20,084 --> 00:55:23,488
make it worthy of the
fund that bears my name.

1174
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:25,857
Thanks, Mike. You won't regret it.

1175
00:55:27,076 --> 00:55:28,893
Bonnie, I'm cutting your book in half.

1176
00:55:28,926 --> 00:55:30,982
You traded against others
instead of for yourself,

1177
00:55:31,017 --> 00:55:32,364
and your call was off.

1178
00:55:32,397 --> 00:55:34,899
Wags'll approve all your trades
until I think you're ready.

1179
00:55:40,772 --> 00:55:42,440
Fuck that.

1180
00:55:44,776 --> 00:55:48,846
If I wanted team spirit,
I would work for fucking Chick-fil-A.

1181
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:11,902
Where's mine?

1182
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:16,875
Philip, I'm doubling the book
you had at your old place.

1183
00:56:16,908 --> 00:56:19,043
Thanks, Mike,
but I'd like it to be halved.

1184
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:21,846
I'll grow my own book
if I can carve more profit.

1185
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:23,348
Fine.

1186
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:24,749
Nice. I like it.

1187
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:26,785
We'll discuss terms privately.

1188
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:29,421
I fucking knew it! You told me not to!

1189
00:56:29,454 --> 00:56:30,622
I'm so sorry.

1190
00:56:30,655 --> 00:56:31,756
Tuk, I'm zeroing you out.

1191
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:33,758
You'll service Philip for now.

1192
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,227
He'll teach you to trade
from fearlessness, not fear.

1193
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,929
Ben, I'm boosting you 10%.

1194
00:56:37,962 --> 00:56:41,099
Keep making the bold plays,
but unwind the protection.

1195
00:56:41,132 --> 00:56:43,134
Lose the training wheels, man.
You don't need 'em.

1196
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:45,870
Taylor Mason Carbon,
you'll keep your full allocation.

1197
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,940
I welcome your new sense of... mission,

1198
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:51,475
as long as it never conflicts with mine.

1199
00:56:52,343 --> 00:56:53,978
Their shit worked.

1200
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:55,413
It worked, all right.

1201
00:56:55,446 --> 00:56:56,948
Thirty million-plus on that trade.

1202
00:56:56,981 --> 00:57:01,019
Taylor went Milken in '85,
and it worked.

1203
00:57:01,052 --> 00:57:02,554
Fucking rapacious.

1204
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:04,856
Yeah, yeah, yeah, not so fast.

1205
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:07,425
I know this can be an all-star team,

1206
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:09,360
but you can play way above the rim.

1207
00:57:09,393 --> 00:57:12,063
But you'll never get there
with blisters on your feet.

1208
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:15,366
That's why I keep hammering
you on the fundamentals.

1209
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:18,469
Position sizing, focus, restraint.

1210
00:57:20,838 --> 00:57:25,944
And, for all your moves,
for all your talent,

1211
00:57:25,977 --> 00:57:27,645
it looks like Axe never
taught you how to put on

1212
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:29,047
your socks and your shoes.
