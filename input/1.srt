1
00:00:04,112 --> 00:00:05,884
Previously on Billions.

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:07,209
I want to introduce the chairman of

3
00:00:07,242 --> 00:00:09,845
the NYC 2028 Olympic Commission,

4
00:00:09,878 --> 00:00:10,946
Michael Prince.

5
00:00:11,588 --> 00:00:12,911
Thank you, Mayor Johnson.

6
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,282
You promised me a winning season, Chuck.

7
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:15,784
Running out of time
before I'll have to quit,

8
00:00:15,817 --> 00:00:17,352
campaign 25/8.

9
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:19,988
I can't lose my MVP yet.
I need you, Kate.

10
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:21,590
Chuck Rhoades is fucking
with our Wi-Fi play.

11
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:24,591
The only winner in this
hopeless fucking outing

12
00:00:24,626 --> 00:00:26,109
is gonna be your chief legal counsel.

13
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:27,229
You think I'm concerned because you

14
00:00:27,262 --> 00:00:29,197
brought my Wi-Fi play back to Chuck?

15
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,366
It's how I know that you'll
serve me loyally as well,

16
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,368
until I help get you
elected to Congress.

17
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:35,256
You made a deal that you
knew would displease me.

18
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,339
I thought we could
actually change the world.

19
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:39,941
If you want to change the world,
nine digits ain't gonna do it.

20
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:41,076
How could you, Kate?

21
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:42,742
After all I taught you.

22
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:44,346
You made me wait.

23
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:45,680
What if the professor
isn't done teaching?

24
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,282
This is business.

25
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:48,950
This is what not having
a soft landing feels like.

26
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:50,805
You tear your butt when
you hit the ground.

27
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,287
Mike Prince and his daughters

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,031
made the world a better place today.

29
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:55,991
I lost my advantage.

30
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:58,990
I failed to protect my goddamn queen.

31
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,295
Welcome to Michael Prince Capital, Kate.

32
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:23,385
My God, let me finish!

33
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:26,235
When was I not letting you finish?

34
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:43,605
Worked pretty well in
Stand and Deliver too.

35
00:01:43,638 --> 00:01:44,973
Life lesson,

36
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:47,575
always carry a cleaver.

37
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,244
Oh, wait. No.

38
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:50,812
That's not really the lesson.

39
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:52,447
The lesson is,

40
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,684
know how to change the
mood in a room quickly

41
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:57,352
and with authority.

42
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:59,220
Now, look,
I get what you're fighting over.

43
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:00,388
I do.

44
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,290
Coding team wants more of the budget

45
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:04,426
because you can't make a
great app without great code.

46
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,424
Sales team wants more because
who cares about the damn code...

47
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:08,763
You want to start moving
product out the door.

48
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,665
Same with the marketing group.

49
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:12,266
But here's the deal.

50
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:15,770
Your customer can have two of these,

51
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,272
not three.

52
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:19,274
Cheap and fast can't also be good.

53
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:21,242
Good and fast can't also be cheap.

54
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:24,179
So you can fight over turf,

55
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:25,513
or...

56
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,050
you can figure out a vision.

57
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:31,987
Let the budget sort itself out.

58
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,021
Or I can double it.

59
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:36,491
Everybody gets what they want,

60
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,460
and I get a word with
the teacher outside.

61
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,628
Not sure that's the right lesson.

62
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,570
Most important one:
"Money makes the rules."

63
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:45,633
I'm surprised an esteemed
charter school like this

64
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,169
hasn't hammered it into their heads.

65
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,839
Why scrap over capital
when you can raise it?

66
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:52,974
Group, we're gonna take five

67
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,076
while Mr. Prince makes out his check.

68
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:59,114
If you came here to impress a bunch of

69
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:00,582
teenage entrepreneurs...

70
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:01,683
Trying to impress you.

71
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:03,818
Hire you. How am I doing?

72
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,153
You opening a charter school?

73
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:06,988
Not for your side gig. Your main gig.

74
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,890
They take care of me at the fund I'm at.

75
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:12,160
Hmm-hmm. That's why
your resume's floating around.

76
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:14,362
In my weaker moments,
I sometimes think about

77
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:16,564
what I could do in a place
built for speed and power.

78
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,432
Then you're talking to the right guy.

79
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,909
Um,

80
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:29,076
what'd you do?

81
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,379
Nothing.

82
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:33,248
Women can be irrational, we know this.

83
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,816
"We" do not. What'd you do?

84
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,084
Not a thing.

85
00:03:36,117 --> 00:03:38,253
I went unattended to a couples dinner.

86
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:40,688
Willow had a cold,
so Roxanne couldn't go.

87
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,924
And the distaff side of the other couple

88
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:44,626
was a fetching brunette...

89
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:47,262
Yeah, you had an affair.
Spare me the Penthouse Forum.

90
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,764
No-siree-Bob. Nothing physical.

91
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:51,533
Developed a kinship

92
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:54,903
with Judith Felker, Ron's wife,

93
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:57,639
over how thin the consommé was.

94
00:03:57,672 --> 00:04:01,470
So uh, Roxanne kicked you out
over dinner table chatter?

95
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:04,282
Well, the next six days of
text chatter didn't help.

96
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:07,582
Did you know that Face ID
works when you're asleep?

97
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:08,883
Why wouldn't it?

98
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,185
You oughta go after Big Tech.

99
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:12,287
I dozed off mid-emoji,

100
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,264
Roxanne grabbed the damn
phone and saw it all.

101
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,626
I'll just drop this here
while I test the beds,

102
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,628
pick out a room.

103
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,442
_

104
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,780
The thing about self-help is,

105
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,715
if you're getting it from
someone else it's not self,

106
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:43,084
and if you're doing it yourself,
you didn't really get help.

107
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:49,691
Carlin.

108
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:51,926
George Carlin. No?

109
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,461
Yeah. All-time great.

110
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,530
But not quite like Coach Wooden.

111
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:58,833
See, he wasn't an entertainer.

112
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,135
He understood life.

113
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:01,603
Codified what he learned,

114
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:03,371
taught it to his basketball players,

115
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:05,223
made it available to the rest of us.

116
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:08,076
As I am now making it available to you.

117
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:10,778
"Initiative," "skill,"

118
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,249
it all seems kinda... basic.

119
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:16,484
Not ItsMeTinx basic.
Like what it used to mean.

120
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,957
I met him once, when we won State's.

121
00:05:18,992 --> 00:05:21,049
Fundamental, not basic. It's different.

122
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:22,590
What'd he teach ya?

123
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,459
How to put on my socks and shoes.

124
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:26,427
How to lace 'em up and tie 'em right.

125
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,862
Know why?

126
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,097
Blisters?

127
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,431
To remember that every season,

128
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,933
we start again from the beginning.

129
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:35,537
We were champions of this season.
Not the next.

130
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,538
So we'd better do everything right.

131
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:40,708
Plus, yeah, blisters.

132
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,454
Not self-help.

133
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:44,678
Help.

134
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,824
- Who's that?
- Beats me.

135
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,160
Ten bucks says he doesn't
have any blisters.

136
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,865
Remember,
you're bowing to the Buddha, not me.

137
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,633
Yes.

138
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:44,038
Daniel.

139
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,606
I'm ready.

140
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,912
Is that the first sign of readiness,
do we think?

141
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:53,514
Stating it.

142
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:56,417
Are you suggesting I'm
not ready to take refuge?

143
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:58,819
Because I have to.

144
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,256
I need to.

145
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,660
What's that?

146
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:06,694
Vegan ice cream.

147
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,830
A gift for you. It's the best...

148
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:10,064
No.

149
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,599
What's that?

150
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:15,236
A gift for you, as I said.

151
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,738
I made it myself.

152
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:18,172
For what purpose?

153
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:22,076
For... to, uh...

154
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,644
To curry favor.

155
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:27,115
The very sweetness of the cream

156
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:28,783
is bitter in this way.

157
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,618
Do not buy friendship

158
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:31,819
or comfort.

159
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,459
Where I come from,

160
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,995
everything's a transaction.

161
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,997
Where you're going...

162
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,465
a commitment to the Buddha,

163
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:47,568
the Dharma, the Sangha,

164
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:51,605
the goal is to avoid being
transactional at all.

165
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,776
Can you do this?

166
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,477
Will you try?

167
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:00,048
I'll start with a month. Go from there.

168
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,249
Start with a day.

169
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:03,351
When I decide something...

170
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:06,253
Start with an hour, even a minute.

171
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:08,822
Then add a minute on to that one.

172
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:12,560
That's the work.

173
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:16,631
We'll meet again in four days,
see how it's going.

174
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:19,067
You're not sure I can
refrain from transacting

175
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,468
for four days?

176
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,604
Whether I'm sure matters not at all.

177
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:26,307
Well, I am.

178
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,443
I'm sure.

179
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:34,381
All right, rack the bid, get it done.

180
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,052
What's he, the new golden boy?

181
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,188
Took Dollar Bill's slot.

182
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:42,724
Probably looking for the
actual dollar to steal too.

183
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:45,473
Coach Wooden always said,

184
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:47,995
"I treat my players fairly,
but not equally.

185
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,664
Depends on performance."

186
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:51,666
And that's what we are evaluating now.
Performance.

187
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,897
Evaluate and decide who starts,
who rides the pine...

188
00:08:54,932 --> 00:08:56,137
And who gets their scholarship pulled.

189
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,905
Now, I've always believed
you live in a house

190
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,407
before renovating,

191
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,743
so you don't sledgehammer
a support beam,

192
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:04,612
put a Barcalounger
where the bar should be.

193
00:09:04,647 --> 00:09:07,840
Well, our grace period
here is coming to an end.

194
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:11,018
This Friday,
I'm reallocating capital at the firm.

195
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,320
If you change strategies,

196
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:14,155
if you stray from the fundamentals,

197
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:16,918
I'll see it, so don't.

198
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:20,774
Position sizing, focus, restraint...

199
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:23,664
consider them our load-bearing walls.

200
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,932
And, uh, oh, yeah, do your best.

201
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,201
For you.

202
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,970
To return to Coach Wooden,

203
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:31,538
"You're the only one who
knows whether you've won."

204
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,477
Pretty sure the guy carving
up our trading dollars

205
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,146
knows whether we've won.

206
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:41,249
Was he looking at me when he said
"Barcalounger?"

207
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:43,751
Quarter ends Friday.

208
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,187
If you fuck up, it'll be locked in,

209
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,388
and you'll be locked out.

210
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,956
What if you fuck up?

211
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,025
Then wake the hell up
from your nightmare

212
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,594
'cause in this life,
I don't ever fuck up.

213
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:01,369
I know you don't want me here.

214
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:03,470
Got that right.

215
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,582
Book a room at the Yale
Club for my father.

216
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,817
Mr. Allard needs you.

217
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,522
Have you decided who
gets Sacker's office yet?

218
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:23,857
Bureau chiefs have been eyeing it.

219
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,529
That's Graceland, we're not touching it.

220
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:35,169
Good. I need ya.

221
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:36,437
No, you need Marie Kondo.

222
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,039
Jesus Christ.

223
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:40,875
You got Aaron Burr's
gun permit lost in here?

224
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:42,477
But let me guess,
you know where everything is,

225
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,011
down to the last carbon.

226
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,346
Nope. Not a clue.

227
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:48,049
Where are we on the
prosecutions Sacker left behind?

228
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:50,051
Flailing, Chuck.

229
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:52,815
I have to admit,
I'm not as savvy on the legal stuff

230
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,094
as certain other aspects of the job.

231
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:56,224
Like this one.

232
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:59,820
Big seafood wholesaler.
Mislabeled half its product,

233
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:01,739
stuck people with cheaper fish instead.

234
00:11:01,774 --> 00:11:03,602
The seafood fraud case,
we need a win on that.

235
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:05,552
To stand with the consumers
who're being fleeced.

236
00:11:05,587 --> 00:11:07,857
Well, we may need
a different opposing counsel.

237
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:10,037
Lady's a pit bull, won't settle it out.

238
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,839
Even though we got her dead to rights.

239
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:15,209
I see that you did need me. Okay.

240
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:18,279
- I'll handle it.
- Good.

241
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:20,548
But that's not why I needed ya.

242
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:23,117
Last night,
in a private suite at the Garden,

243
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,053
a young woman walks up
to Governor Sweeney,

244
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:27,855
told him he's wrecking
the Empire State...

245
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:31,025
- Hmm.
- ...and not that nicely.

246
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:32,093
People heard it.

247
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:35,230
My sources tell me it was Gail Prince.

248
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:37,331
- Mike Prince's...
- Oh, I know who she is.

249
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,966
Governor Sweeney still doesn't.

250
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:44,005
Buffalo Bob finds that out,
he's gonna get ornery.

251
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:45,540
Page Six. Call over there and...

252
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:47,241
That I know how to do.

253
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:48,543
This'll be sweet.

254
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:50,211
As a Coolatta with extra syrup.

255
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:52,947
The Commission never
awards the Games to a place

256
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,882
it doesn't feel completely welcome in.

257
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,083
So...

258
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,485
This should pretty much lead to the end

259
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:59,152
of Mike Prince's Olympic bid.

260
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,164
Don't call my mom till I can explain...

261
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,599
Mom already got the call.

262
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,037
Let's get Kate Sacker in here.

263
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,039
First, I'd like to get
Philip Charyn out of here,

264
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,774
and understand how he even got in.
